  * Improve error message when /sys/block is missing.
  * os-prober doesn't know how to probe other OSes on non-Linux kernels.
    For now, just exit quietly rather than confusing people (closes:
    #567953).
  * Ignore active swap partitions (thanks, Alex Owen; see #417407).
  * Refactor linux_mount_boot to look up labels and UUIDs using blkid or
    /dev/disk/by-*/ rather than relying on mount being smart enough.  This
    removes some horrible code that executes mount from /target.
  * Set partitions read-only before mounting them (based on a patch by Alex
    Owen; closes: #417407, #556739, #599203).

os-prober (1.34) unstable; urgency=low

  * Only look for a smart version of mount if we're using busybox mount. In
    a normal system, mount probably already handles labels and UUIDs, and
    using mount from another filesystem is risky enough that it's worth
    avoiding if possible.
  * Memoise calls to 'basename $0' in log function.
  * Handle escaped special characters in /etc/fstab and /proc/mounts
    (LP: #433910).
  * dash defines test's -nt operator differently from bash, as it's entitled
    to do since this is an extension not defined in POSIX. If file1 exists
    and file2 does not, bash returns true but dash returns false. Don't rely
    on bash's behaviour when checking whether to use GRUB Legacy or GRUB 2
    configuration files, otherwise we end up using neither when only one set
    of configuration exists and /bin/sh is dash.
  * Try to map LABEL= and UUID= ourselves in linux_mount_boot rather than
    relying on mount to do it, to further reduce the chance that we need to
    use mount from another filesystem.
  * If the filesystem identified by linux-boot-prober as /boot is already
    mounted somewhere else, then bind-mount it rather than trying to mount
    it again.

  * Use vol_id/blkid output if possible to avoid having to try every

  * Skip grub-installer's "(on /dev/blah)" entries detected in GRUB
    configuration files, as if they're useful they will probably be found by
    another probe, and detecting them can result in exponential growth of
    menu.lst files if you do repeated test installs on multiple partitions.
  * Use readlink -f in mapdevfs shim so that os-prober runs outside d-i
    handle mount-by-UUID correctly.
  * Use mktemp -d rather than /tmp, to make use outside d-i safer.
  * Merge from Ubuntu:
    - Try to install fs-core-modules and fs-secondary-modules udebs. These
      are specific to the Ubuntu kernel udeb layout, but it's fairly cheap
      to check for them as well and saves on divergence here.
    - Add os-probes/mounted/sparc/80solaris to recognize Solaris/SPARC
      (Fabio M. Di Nitto).
    - Add linux-boot-probes/mounted/sparc/50silo support (Fabio M. Di
      Nitto).
    - Try to load ufs module, for Solaris support (Fabio M. Di Nitto).
    - Tighten check for whether we're running in d-i; anna-install isn't
      quite enough because if you're running d-i code outside d-i it's
      sometimes reasonable to install a shim for anna-install.
  * Don't probe partitions mounted on /target/boot.
  * Teach linux-boot-prober to deal with mounted partitions correctly,
    unless they're mounted on /, /target, or /target/boot (LP: #14780). This
    should largely obsolete the --mounted option.
  * Only use /target/bin/mount if it exists, in order to work better outside

  * Skip partitions on a physical disk that is part of a Serial ATA RAID disk.
  * Use log-output when checking for volume groups.
  * Also use the case insensitive test for Dell Utility partition detection.

  [ Fabio M. Di Nitto ]
  * Skip partitions that have the "whole_disk" sysfs attribute set.
    The kernel set the attribute for partitions like SUN Whole Disk.
    These partitions that encompass the whole disk can be mounted
    and often confused for the first partition on the disk.
    In situations where the OS is on the first partition, it would be

  * Patch from VMiklos to add --mounted option to linux-boot-prober.
    May not be useful for d-i but in other situations including for the

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * When parsing a lilo configuration, dereference symbolic links. Not doing

    - Initialise variables in lilo and grub probes, to avoid inheriting
      settings for things like $initrd from the kernel command line.
      This fixes processing of things like lilo.conf stanzas that do not set
      an initrd. Thanks to Frans Pop.
    - Add some extra debug logging.

    - Add a Mac OS 6-9 check for powerpc. This is currently a copy of the
      m68k version with a different loader name for yaboot's benefit, which
      may not be ideal ...
    - Send modprobe's standard output to syslog so that it doesn't confuse
      programs parsing os-prober's output.

os-prober (0.06) unstable; urgency=low

  * Colin Watson
    - Add a Linux boot probe for /etc/yaboot.conf.
    - Make sure hfs is available for the Mac OS 9 check.
    - Delay hfs until last in mounted checks so that we can tell the
      difference between that and hfsplus.
    - Add count to Mac OS X labels; change loader type to macosx.
    - Add myself to Uploaders.

  * Joey Hess
    - Fix broken mounting of /boot partitions.
    - Fix grub probe to support systems that have /boot on a separate
      partition, by looking for kernels in /boot as well.
    - Same for initrds.

os-prober (0.04) unstable; urgency=low

  * Joey Hess
    - Return "hurd" as the OS type for hurd, rather than "multiboot".
      The latter is not enough info to boot the hurd.
    - Fix broken hurd detection.

    - Remove broken depends line.
    - Add a linux boot probe that searches for kernels and initrds with no
      bootloader config file, as a fallback.
    - Add a linux boot probe that parses /etc/lilo.conf.
