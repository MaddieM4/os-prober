os-prober (1.10) unstable; urgency=low

os-prober (1.09) unstable; urgency=low

  * To make it easier to use os-prober outside d-i, add a mapdevfs shim and
    avoid using anna-install if it isn't present.
  * Fix count_for to avoid failing outside d-i if /var/lib/os-prober/labels
    is missing.
  * Look for partitions in /sys/block if /dev/discs isn't present.
  * Add /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL reference to debian/copyright.
  * Rename os-prober to os-prober-udeb (leaving a Provides: behind) and
    create an os-prober deb.
  * Avoid yaboot probe failing outside d-i due to archdetect being missing.
  * Don't install /var/lib/os-prober/mount in either binary package, just
    /var/lib/os-prober; the former will be created/removed on the fly
    anyway.

os-prober (1.08) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Install necessary kernel modules on the fly using anna-install, rather
    than depending on them. Requires anna >= 1.16.

 -- Frans Pop <fjp@debian.org>  Tue, 15 Nov 2005 20:37:52 +0100

os-prober (1.07) unstable; urgency=low

os-prober (1.06) unstable; urgency=low

  * Frans Pop
    - Make idempotent by deleting files in /var/lib/os-prober/ on start
      (resets count_next_label).
    - Properly determine whether partitions are mounted or not by using
      mapdevfs to match device names. Closes: #251794, #251662.
    - Add dependency on di-utils-mapdevfs.

os-prober (1.05) unstable; urgency=low

  * Colin Watson
    - 'boot' is implicit at the end of a grub menu entry. Cope with it being
      missing (part of #258623).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat, 26 Mar 2005 16:55:23 +0000

os-prober (1.04) unstable; urgency=low

  * Joey Hess
    - Fix micosoft and lsb tests to use count_next_label to get unique
      short labels. Closes: #299001

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 11 Mar 2005 14:06:00 -0500

os-prober (1.03) unstable; urgency=low

  * Joey Hess
    - Applied patch from Guillem Jover to detect many redhat derived
      distributions.
  * Frans Pop
    - Exclude partitions that are part of a software raid array.
      Closes: #273960.
    - Don't use the description from Windows' boot.ini if it contains
      non-ascii (or other unusual) characters. Closes: #293859.
  * Colin Watson
    - Probe ext3, xfs, and jfs modules too.

os-prober (1.02) unstable; urgency=low

  * Joshua Kwan
    - I don't have time to test/improve os-prober these days, so removing
      myself from Uploaders.
  * Colin Watson
    - Install i386 tests on amd64 too (closes: #261378).

os-prober (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * Joey Hess
    - Applied patch from eddyp to parse boot.ini to determine correct names
      of modern versions of Windows. Closes: #275882

os-prober (1.00) unstable; urgency=low

  * Joey Hess
    - Fedora uses a grub.conf. This may or may not be linked to menu.lst
      (unknown). Look for it if menu.lst is not found.
    - Gratuitous version number bump.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun,  3 Oct 2004 18:27:10 -0400

os-prober (0.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Joey Hess
    - It's actually allowed and common for /etc/lsb-release to not include a
      DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION or DISTRIB_CODENAME, so don't call such distros
      "Unknown semi-LSB-compliant Linux distribution", just skip to the next
      test. This affected FC2.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 27 Aug 2004 12:57:06 -0400

os-prober (0.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Giuseppe Sacco
    - Added preliminary test for Solaris/IA32. Closes: #255206
  * Joey Hess
    - Add support for fstabs with UUIDs or disk labels. Closes:#257794
    - In fallback os-prober test, skip over symlinks, since they could point
      from root into /boot or result in confusing duplicate entries.
      Closes: #258624
    - Make the fallback os-prober really find kernels matched by globs.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 10 Jul 2004 14:32:17 -0400

os-prober (0.12) unstable; urgency=low

    - Fix syntax error in already-mounted case.
    - Cope with empty initrd parameter in yaboot.conf parser.

os-prober (0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Colin Watson
    - Make linux-distro test work on architectures that don't have
      /lib/ld-linux.so* (closes: #244076).
    - Fix a typo in the yaboot parser.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sun,  9 May 2004 16:35:43 +0100

os-prober (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Colin Watson
    - Restore module dependencies, using debian/module-depends.$(ARCH).
      Closes: #246700
  * Joey Hess
    - Have os-prober run mounted tests on partitions that are already
      mounted (skipping /  and /target). Closes: #247080

os-prober (0.08) unstable; urgency=low

  * Joey Hess
    - Initialise variables in lilo and grub probes, to avoid inheriting
      settings for things like $initrd from the kernel command line.
      This fixes processing of things like lilo.conf stanzas that do not set
      an initrd. Thanks to Frans Pop.
    - Add some extra debug logging.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 20 Apr 2004 16:40:16 -0400

os-prober (0.07) unstable; urgency=low

  * Colin Watson
    - Add a Mac OS 6-9 check for powerpc. This is currently a copy of the
      m68k version with a different loader name for yaboot's benefit, which
      may not be ideal ...
    - Send modprobe's standard output to syslog so that it doesn't confuse
      programs parsing os-prober's output.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sun, 18 Apr 2004 11:23:51 +0100

os-prober (0.06) unstable; urgency=low

  * Colin Watson
    - Add a Linux boot probe for /etc/yaboot.conf.
    - Make sure hfs is available for the Mac OS 9 check.
    - Delay hfs until last in mounted checks so that we can tell the
      difference between that and hfsplus.
    - Add count to Mac OS X labels; change loader type to macosx.
    - Add myself to Uploaders.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Wed, 14 Apr 2004 01:15:53 +0100

os-prober (0.05) unstable; urgency=low

  * Joey Hess
    - Fix broken mounting of /boot partitions.
    - Fix grub probe to support systems that have /boot on a separate
      partition, by looking for kernels in /boot as well.
    - Same for initrds.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 10 Apr 2004 16:06:49 -0400

os-prober (0.04) unstable; urgency=low

  * Joey Hess
    - Return "hurd" as the OS type for hurd, rather than "multiboot".
      The latter is not enough info to boot the hurd.
    - Fix broken hurd detection.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri,  9 Apr 2004 22:18:54 -0400

os-prober (0.03) unstable; urgency=low

  * Joshua Kwan
    - Allow for unique short names via functions in new common.sh library.
    - Revamp all the dh_install stuff.
    - Use /var/lib/os-prober as our sandbox.
  * Colin Watson
    - Add Mac OS X probing support.
  * Joey Hess
    - Added linux-boot-prober, with sorta working support for grub.
    - Reorg the probes, and move to /usr/lib.
    - Remove broken depends line.
    - Add a linux boot probe that searches for kernels and initrds with no
      bootloader config file, as a fallback.
    - Add a linux boot probe that parses /etc/lilo.conf.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed,  7 Apr 2004 21:40:39 -0400
